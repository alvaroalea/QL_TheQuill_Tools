# Demo Adventure (Spanish)

Debby Howard and Simon Avery published in 1995 the only book I know that talk about development adventures with The Quill.

USING THE QUILL - A Beginner's Guide -

This folder contains a spanish traslation of this adventure in a Sinclair QL database format and in a .txt format.

Be aware that The Quill for Sinclair QL expect that some propieties of the file to be set, and this is not posible conserv in github, so probably this file don't work on real or emulated QL, I'm working in a solution.

This adventure has corrected some typos that appear in the book.
